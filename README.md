### Technology Review

As part of my progress, I have written a review on some state of the art controversy detection methods [in this PDF](https://github.com/HeapsOfRam/tech_review/blob/main/techreview.pdf)

## Sources

Most of this code is copied directly from the project [Measuring controversy in Social Networks through NLP](https://github.com/jmanuoz/Measuring-controversy-in-Social-Networks-through-NLP).
I additionally referenced [this controversy-detection project](https://github.com/gvrkiran/controversy-detection) when trying to create networks and run the controversy detection.
